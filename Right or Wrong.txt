Your Three-Card Tarot Spread: Past, Present, Future
Past: The Child 👶🌟 (Upright)
Meaning: New start, innocence, curiosity, beginner, apprentice, small, playful.

Interpretation: In the past, you approached a situation with a fresh perspective, full of curiosity and openness, much like a child exploring the world. This could represent a time when you embarked on a new journey, project, or relationship with enthusiasm and a willingness to learn. Your innocent and playful mindset allowed you to embrace possibilities without judgment or fear, setting the stage for growth. This card suggests that your intentions were pure, and your actions were driven by a desire to explore or create something new. Reflect on this time—did it involve a small but meaningful step that felt exciting or liberating?

Present: The Fish 🐟💰 (Reversed)
Meaning: Poor business, depleted resources, missed opportunities.

Interpretation: Currently, you may be facing challenges related to resources, whether financial, emotional, or energetic. The reversed Fish indicates a sense of restriction or loss, possibly due to missed opportunities or decisions that didn’t pan out as hoped. This card suggests you might feel stuck or uncertain about your current path, questioning whether you’ve made the right choices. The question “Am I doing wrong?” aligns with this energy, reflecting doubt or worry about recent actions. The Fish reversed urges you to pause, reassess, and manage what you have carefully. Are there areas where you can conserve energy or resources to regain stability? This is a time to focus on practical steps to recover and rebuild.

Future: The Dog 🐶🤝 (Reversed)
Meaning: Betrayal, unreliable friends, strained relationships.

Interpretation: Looking ahead, the reversed Dog warns of potential challenges in relationships or trust. You may encounter situations where support from others feels lacking, or you might face disloyalty or misunderstandings in friendships or partnerships. This card doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “doing wrong,” but it suggests that your future path may involve navigating strained connections. It’s a call to be cautious about who you trust and to prioritize relationships that feel genuine and reciprocal. If you’re feeling uncertain about your actions, this card encourages you to align with people who share your values and to protect your emotional boundaries as you move forward.

Synthesis and Guidance
Your question, “Am I doing wrong?” seems to stem from a place of self-doubt, possibly triggered by the challenges reflected in the present (The Fish, reversed). The reading suggests that your past was marked by a pure, curious approach (The Child, upright), which indicates that your intentions were likely good and your actions were rooted in a desire for growth or exploration. However, the present shows struggles with resources or missed opportunities, which may be causing you to question your decisions. The future (The Dog, reversed) warns of potential relational challenges, suggesting that your path forward may involve reevaluating who you trust and ensuring your actions align with your core values.

Advice: You’re not inherently “doing wrong,” but you may be in a phase where outcomes haven’t matched your expectations, leading to self-doubt. Focus on managing your resources wisely in the present and seek clarity about your goals. Be mindful of the company you keep moving forward—surround yourself with reliable, supportive people. Reflect on what “doing right” means to you, and let that guide your next steps. Trust your inner curiosity (The Child) to lead you toward recovery and authentic connections.

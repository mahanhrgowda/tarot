Personalized Tarot Reading App
About the Process
This app generates a personalized tarot reading using your name, question (optional), and the current real time in the selected timezone. These details create a unique seed for the random number generator, combined with the current system time to mimic real-world unpredictability—like shuffling a physical deck at different moments. This ensures each reading is unique yet tied to your personal inputs. Cards are randomly selected and can appear upright or reversed, providing nuanced interpretations.
